_Result: **2:2**_

Sufficient work. Miscomprehension of lambda choosing in Q2, which should be estimated via MLE instead of treated as a tuning parameter. 
Good demonstration of the trading algorithm in Q3. 
The performance of models should be based on the performance of Sharpe ratios using different window lengths but the paper failed to do so, hence the critical analysis is not enough.

**Improvements:**

- Adjusted method for finding Lambda
- Improved critcal analysis using Sharpe Ratios for different window lengths
